# 100 Days of Code: Updated Coffee Shops Site

Day 88 of the 100 Days of Code course. For this project, the goal was to create an updated version of the coffee shops project from earlier in the course. 

The oroginal coffee shop website from day 62 had three routes. The home page, a page that lists the coffee shops and a hidden route, add, that can be used to add coffee shops to the shops list. When a shop was added using the add route, the details for that shop were saved in a csv file. The route that listed the shops was then rendered using the rows from that csv file.
